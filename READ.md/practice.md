#### This is both my submission for both _Markdown and GIT assessment reflection._
1. What is the difference between staging and committing
  > When staging you are preparing the additions to be add to your code as such the staging area acts as a "holding space". Committing permanently saves your changes. This is the issue I was having earlier in my assignment. I would stage but not commit the changes.
2. Which is a better commit message?
  >Between the options given the second option is better. This isn't just for other people contributing but it also helps you when looking back to remember what and why it something was changed.
3. When should you run git status.
  > Frequently the more you use it the better you are able to both understand and keep track of what is happening after each git operation.
