### Binary Reflection
##### What suprised me about Todd's video
I have to admit I was already familiar with a good majority of the content in Todd's video, I did think that the tidbit about the power button symbolizing the marker for 0 _off_ and 1 _on_.
##### How I would explain binary
Binary is a system of "switches" represented by 1's and 0's that turn on and off. 1's represent on and 0's represent off. With a large amount of these you can assign meaning to a string of binary depending on how many are on and how many are off and in what order.
