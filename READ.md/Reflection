I finally have the hang off the connection between Visual Studio Code and GITHUB however git is still giving me some issues. I've probably done this assignment 3 times trying to get the GIT apps to connect so that i can see it in GIT HUB everything says that it's connected. As I am typing this out however I am realizing that I may not be pushing my commints and repositories to GITHUB and that is most likely my issue. Other than that the basic command of creating Files and respositoreis in Git on a local device are quite easy.
